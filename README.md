# Weekly Project Challenges

Welcome to my **Weekly Project Challenges** repository!  
Each week, I'll be creating and uploading a new project that tackles a problem, aiming to continuously improve my development skills.

## Projects
The repository will grow over time with new and interesting projects. You can find all the projects in the repository, and also the last two projects below, along with a brief description and a link to their respective folders.
